# Target Architecture - RAM for augmented Dataset
An attempt to implement the idea from Recurrent Models of Visual Attention, Volodymyr Mnih, Nicolas Heess, Alex Graves, Koray Kavukcuoglu, https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6247

The idea is to compute customized gradient for Location Network in order to compute policy gradient for stochastic network, detailed explained in [this blog]()

Code extended from [this repo](https://github.com/yanji84/deep-recurrent-attention-model)
